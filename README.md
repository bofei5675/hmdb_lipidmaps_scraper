# Scraper for LIPIPMAPS ID in hmdb

Since hmdb hinds their LIPIDMAPS ID inside their source file, we decided to grab this by web crawler. This script will go about one week to grab all LIPIDMAPS ID it can find by crawl all metabolites website.

Prerequesite:
* Python 3.5
* Package such as urlib,bs4,pandas,sqlalchemy
* RaMP database installed (or you need to have all hmdb metabolites ID to looking at single websites)
